# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).

See the ___review___ branch for changes I made after submiting my solutions and
exploring other people's solutions.

## Programs used

* Day 1 - [CHICKEN Scheme](https://www.call-cc.org/) v5.2
* Day 2 - [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) v8.3
* Day 3 - Python v3.10
* Day 4 - Node.js v16.11
* Day 5 - Go v1.16
* Day 6 - [Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL)](http://www.sbcl.org/) v2.0
* Day 7 - Rust v1.57
* Day 8 - [TempleOS](https://templeos.org/) v5.03

### How do I run the day 8 solution?

The day 8 solution is written in HolyC and at the time of writing can only be
run inside the TempleOS operating system.

You should run TempleOS in a virtual machine (VM) and copy the solution and
input file by either storing them in an ISO file and inserting it in the CD
drive of the VM, or by modifying the disk image of the virtual machine.

If the VM uses the qcow2 disk image format, you can follow
[these instructions](https://gist.github.com/shamil/62935d9b456a6f9877b5)
to mount and modify it on a Linux-based OS.
